== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Nope. The plugin is ready to go once you install it.

= Which users can I delete using this plugin? =
Be careful, you will delete all users (subscribers, administrators, editors, authors, contributors, link authors and no role users) using this plugin. In next version I will give the option to delete based on users role.

If a user has posts in the Trash, then that user will not be deleted.
